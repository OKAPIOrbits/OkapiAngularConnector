# OkapiAngularConnector

This project contains a service, which allows to interface with OKAPI's backend. The important piece of code is `services/okapi.service.ts`, which you can re-use in your own app. In `app.components.ts` you can find a very basic example implementation of the service. Please note that you must be signed up at https://okapiorbits.space and also prove your own CDM file in json format from https://space-track.com. In future iterations more example calls to the backend will be implemented.  

## Prerequisite 

You need to have npm installed, e.g. from npmjs.org or on macOS you can use brew and run `brew install npm` in the terminal.

## Build and Run

After cloning please run `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
